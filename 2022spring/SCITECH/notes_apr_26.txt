Techno-optimism

Trump announced a techno-chauvinist push that apple and google would handle the 
covid outbreak even though they haven't and have never seen such a request

We should anlayze the ways that Silicon Valley actually was trying to handle the pandemic 
The specific areas that silicon valley companies were interested in using tech was: 
Your phone would be able to listen to you for coughs (the idea would be to take away responsibility from humans) 
"Tech for good" is a good red flag

Optimism sounds so wholesome, but the companies that are involved go back between hands of funding

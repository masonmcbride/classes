REVIEW from last class
technological determinism (good in theory, but it does not map to public) - if we can look at the technological system, everything else will follow, according to t.d. social progression is teleological- it determines the future
path dependence: ex. the fossil fuel industry is path depedent on the oil path since we created all of our cars oaffordances: eg. a hotline you can call at any time and any place, since hotline voluteers are scheduled, one can find when a certain person is on-line and use it as a form of ad-hoc therapy

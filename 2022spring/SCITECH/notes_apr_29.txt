Speculative fiction is trying to return science fiction to a high art
Often in terms of fantasy, which is considered the lowest of science fiction

speculation - greek form of watching
            - specular

Coming back to truth 
Fantasy vs. the New World has always been central,
it often has a dystopian impulse when critiquing the New World of the present

Science fction new worlds that are different not seen as neutral 


Especially in California and the west coast, it's definitely a present New World
It's mostly about Norcal but i guess there could be socal too

Manifest Destiny - it was about the entire continent just not east to west
(technically partially failed)

the marterial speculation of the gold rush immediately created california as a state

LA and norcal are always in conversation with one another,
Silicon valley is where are quotidian is constantly being manufactured

We made the atom bomb in berkeley, and then berkeley faculty left to the desert with the knowledge

The shockwave rider (California in the future)
Neuromancer, William Gibson
Snow Crash (introduced the metaverse)

Throughout the late 80s and early 90s made early text-based conferencing

Speculative Design
creating conceptual artifacts to explore possible futures or alternative worlds
By asking what if scenarios, you can explore the implications of technological futures

But it always comes from the minds of their creators, 
Over-focus on issues of direct use ("I (personally) would not lilke to use this device"),
intead of thinking of equilibrium changing arguments about the design of something

Life worlds are often implicit, 


Tips 


1. speculate the same artifact in different life worlds
2. speculate about the stakeholders beyond just the users for these objects
3. Focus on the bureaucratic mundane (for example I don't know how waste water is regulated)

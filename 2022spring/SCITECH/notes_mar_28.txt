---------------Supply Chains and Infrastructure-----------------

When things break down, that's when we discover how they work

Logistics: refined, assembled, shipped

Smartphones contain 30 precious metals
like silicon, silica sand
the most versatile and technologically capable sand
Silicon valley is not called that because it's rich in materials
it's because of the company who makes chips
North/South carolina is a big silicon repo(sitory)
the most pureof silicon is used in computer chips

once small towns get depleted of their silicon, 
google and amazon place server farms on them
Companies in Spruce pine dominate the world flows of silicon
Mines are visible 

In infrastructure studies, when things are visible it's time we can see how they work
and silicon mines are visible

99.99999% purity and then four more 9s get added with further refinement
sand is infinitely purifiable

Since the mining of silicon valley gets farther and farther away,
it's harder to see the infrastructure

The groundwater is silicon valley is destroyed because of the mines

100kg silicon ingots are sliced into wafers, and are futher refined and polished

Also sometimes chips don't work, so manufacturers make enough chips to yield

The use of cobalt:
cobalt is used for part of our batteries but decays
when your phone breaks, it could be the cobalt
also that's why batteries get worse over time

The human cost of mining of mining cobalt in the DRC
is terrible. Children and adults are the miners 
They have to dig with hand tools extremely deep in the earth

In 2016 Todd C was the first to connect the cobalt mines in the congo 
to the smartphone supply chain

supply chain: the sequence of processes involved in the production of a commodity

The US has a new rule that companies have to "at least attempt" to verify
their resources are not from "militia controlled" areas
but they don't have to do it for cobalt

What if we all collectively owned the supply chain 
Like governments own and run the chain but everyday people should just have access too
keywords: open-access 

Bringing the supply chain of a company up today, is to further complicate
the socio-technical systems whether or not we know.

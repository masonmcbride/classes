-----Feminist STS interventions into technology & medicine

The rubber wheel has a very gendered history

Read McGraw again and analyze how she makes her arguments about the objects

Labor, labor done out of the home and misremembered as masculinized 

Feminization of labor- an account of how labor changes over time
(1)
what follows from feminization is the loss of value in the field
ex: nursing, has been devalued over current times, despite the crazy amounts of work they do
ex: elementary school,
ex: computing

(2) Work is becoming like the home (gendered in terms of its affects)
It's not just that these fields get devalued, but what kind of affect we expect at work 
"service with a smile" "work is family"- these are feminized affects that first come service
then bleed into every sector
Also didn't reduce hours or increase pay

Watch "League of your Own"

Work doesn't just get feminized but it also gets masculinzed
This dynamic is much better analyzing a iterative process of women's labor

Heroines of history
"Hidden Figures" (movie/book) Women of Nasa
Grace Hopper first person to develop a compiler for a programming language 
Ada Lovelace (Lord Byron's Daughter), at Oxford there's a building named after her

Women were the first programmers and contributed substantially to the industry
in the 70s and 80s computing becomes masculinized when it used to be feminized

softwork become software
and hardware becomes masculinized

in the 60s, there is a switch in telecom from analog calling to digial calling
The reason women become automate dout was because of paid time off and disability

GUI and MIT Media Lab 
exportation of US techno-solutionism 

a compute-er was a woman doing massive amounts of calculations by hand

When ENIAC was the computer (it was turing-complete)
During this time men thought computers were "boring, stupid, and soft labor"
"The real glory came from making the machines" - hardware

Women were recruited into IBM, and they were making the first punch cards
They were treated as equivalent to secretaries 

Many protocols we have in place now (beta-testing)
The erasure was pretty total, ENIAC was scrubbed of women  

First woman professor around 1970 (1 professor)

In 1984, Apple debuts the Apple 2
-> Computers are really cools
So now boys think software is cool, insane
And women lose all ground they made in computing and well-paid labor

STS tries to locate a responsibility (why did the features <not bug> get baked in)

Computer Historian Janet Abbate
underyling the assumption is that women were good programemrs because they were already automated, 
and in turn could produce could computers
-> fem-zation to mas-zation is multiply determined

"Your Computer is on fire"- the most wonderful, readable, teachable books from the STS 
perspective in computing

There has been a "Women's Recession" over the last 2 years over childcare 

The pipeline is to farmer (tinkerer [tractor, radio, etc]) -> MIT -> Silicon Valley

Most chip production is done by indigenous women

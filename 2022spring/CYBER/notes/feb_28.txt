What do you imagine Hicks and Hayles
in both cases women are being defined by their relationship to men

We are always concerne dabout the human that comes across as machine-like

Both were imagine horrors about the economy, machines, jobs, and automation

Men is clear tare anxious about the future 

Hayle's How We Became Posthuman, you are no longer making distinctions that human is above all else
Chemistry and Literature 
A marxist approach to the family structure. Going back all the way to conceieve how the family came to be
You identify control with surivival and you have to dominate something else to create that control

Hicks- women's control over their own labor
Hayles- Letting go of the fantasy of control

The need for control is recursive until the very end

He sees transitions in the economy 

You don't understand it but you see how large amounts of women are fully understand it

You have to learn the machine's algorithms, which mean syou have to learn how to think like a machine,
and then you can apply that socially

Anxious- anxious about the rising skilling women are receiving in learning how to program, computer, and interact with machine systems.
also anxiety from the machine- and Phillip K. Dick finds these machine-like qualities developing in women as well

and
Control- and the way you control this anxiety is by creating a 
ie. an ideological mode of controlling women's labor power

Phillip K. Dick did not conceive of emotions come to you
The current system is designed in a way where
"absense of appropirate affect" is no longer a concern, because
this is the normal way of life now

Contaniing the future
Probabilistic modeling allows the future to be predicted and
thus (potentially) contained)

the ability to record and receall information
thus emerges as a primary concern for cybernetics 

for human- recording and recall center around memory
for machine- they center around storage

Useful theories of memory were already available (for Wiener)


Freud- the subconcious and unconscious served as sites of storages
but both were unreliable and could call up unexpected memories
in response
Everything is contained n the psyche
(seen in Dreams, or Free Association)


Bergson- memory always combined past and future in a process of becoming
There is no distinction between reality and consciousness, 
which meant that mediation was neither required nor even possible
Everything resides in processing the process of becoming

Cybernetic theory of behavior- there is no motivation, the person is a black box
and we are simply reacting to stimuli

They have devised ways of studying the mind as a abstraction, 
once, you have reached this state, you can begin applying technics 
to create a technical version of a system (ie. in this case, the Brain)

Conc- They are taking control out of our decisions, we are programmed by our
libidinal desires



MEDIA STUDIES:
Cinema provided an emerging way of rendering memory

Vertigo and Timelapse are ways of perceiving perception 
We are unable to see the world like that until cinema invented a method
that put those possibilities into our imagination


**Time through cinema was spatialzied**
The idea of cinema frames- we were creating moments in time that were essentially 
the same but were all frames of recording
So we can use cinema to understand the impacts of cybernetics

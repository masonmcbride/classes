-------Rationality and its Discontents

psychosis: a serious mental illness char. by defective or lost contact
with reality often with hallucinations or delusions 

-Q How can logic be both psychotic and rational (Halpern 146)

In a certain way, psychosis IS perfectly logical, only it lacks
a proper sense of context, ie. a different context from what _we_ share


Computer logic doesn't understand anything that is not translatable into binary code
ie., Fn -> F2

If brains were functionally equiv to comp, 
then it should be poss. to fix. pathological erros in memory (storage), 
thinking (proccessing), and perception (type confusion) 
It should be possible to model human thinking to predict behavior

J. vonN. formalized "rational actor theory" 

Autopoiesis: "Self-creating"
organizational closure: "living systems operate within the boundaries of an organization that 
closes in on itself and leaves the world on the outside" 
organization: the complex web of all possible relationships that can be realized by the autopoeitic 
processes as they interact with one another. 
structural coupling: all living organisms must be structually coupled to their environments
to continue living

Perception starts at the instrument: this suggests that what is perceived 
from the eye starts in the eye, and the way the eye is made which influences how it perceives

Instead of the post-structural pov that narratives influence reality

vol-amps
voluntary amputee 
most amputees are involuntary amputees
so, why does vol-amps become a thing?
This creates an interesting tension
Why would you voluntarily get an amputation

When something moves quickly, we can't control it
speed kills, speed sacrifices quality
To control speed, you create voluntary immobility (there is logic to this)
Why is the logic twisted? It's assuming the worst case is what we want to avoid at all costs

Prosthetics- the ability to extend the human body through media
What is restored to them? Controlled mobility
Recognition of another cycle here

There is a sense that splitting has produced it's own self-evolving logic
When you split you reach a point where you split again


Ambiguity- the inability to distinguish between two wholes (in some partial or whole way)


The problem is with these cycling logics
Turning ideas into logics into closed systems and we are all along for the ride
What can we do? 

Drug addiction cycle
upper-downer cycle

the mental health-drug cycle
In terms of medication you have freedom to do whatever you want

The logic of it is very limited, 
Those kind of logics have a problem because they go for an immediate solution, 
with no perception of making decisions for the future

The Logic of Truncation is a self-reproducing logic
"Truncation is necessary if the part is able to reconfigure itself as a whole"-which is a logic
The problem with splitting is that it begets more splitting

If you had a logic that tried to control the future as well


Q-Do you have any resources for logic what logic is, 
Q-Do you think 

Androids are mostly used as workers, as soldiers, and as sex objects
What all of these have in common is manufactured control, 
where the android is fully controlled by the user.

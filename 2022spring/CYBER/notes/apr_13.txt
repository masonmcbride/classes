Donna Haraway's wants us to recognize the political and social possibilities
that exist with cybernetic ideas

What can the cyborg represent? 
A- hybridity, permeability, liminality
not exactly one thing _or_ the other but somethign in the middle
Somethign that resists all binary possibilities
Not birth, but generation 

Rebirth is part of the carrot that partiarchal capitalism has been dangling 
over us forever, instead we should focus on the regenerative parts of the world

a + a = a \iff a = 0

a + (a + 0) = (a) + (0)
     a + 0  =  0
     a      =  0 



vs. embodiment- the concrete specific and context-depdendent experiences
                of having and being a body,
                our habits, rituals, practices, gestures, pain,


There are differences in the concrete abstractions of ideals we have on our body
and there's the actual practical values we try to optimize

Siren 

Many stories include a mad male scientist and a rebellius robot

I remember when I was a kid there was still that same anxiety about 
the idea that ai will be able to gain a mind of it's own and take over humanity,
but I remember I (and others) would reply, "these robots are not as smarat as you think they are"

This is a stage where science fiction is not as gleefully optimistic (as opposed to previous french films)
After WWI, people were acutely aware of the destruvtive power of technology and machines

Before, there was optimism
Most films post WWI, included conflict, specifically conflict between their masters

Gender could appear in the robotic imagination: robots were a potential 
threat to women and a sexual competitor to men

Electro the Moto-man: He walks, talks, smokes, and sings. 
Implicitly, Electro implies the existence of a mastermind "pulling the strings"
in the background

The Wizard of Oz: the greatest science fiction novel of all time

Deus Ex Machina: Narratively, a solution
Latin- God from Machine
In Greek, it was a theatrical device used to hoist an actor from off-stage
to on-stage, one of the earliest forms of special effects

Film relies on deus ex machina regularly,
The most special effects you have, you can rely on a coherent narrative less and less

There exists an ecology of robots throughout cinema history

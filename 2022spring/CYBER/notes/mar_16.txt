Chapter 4-
The 1960s was an era of government megaprojects 

Brazillia looks like an integrated chip

This is the era where human settlement takes on the internal structure of computers

buses, relays, channels

The very very big could act like the very very small
this suggest a globalist perspective where they believe they can control arge areas with global rules

in the '70s trememdous amonts of money was poured into nuclear power plants

nuclear reactors are objects of massive centralization- one fixed point provides power 
on all network lines 

This is also a time of massive industry conglomeration.
ITT Corporation, LItton Ind., LTV where based in defense, telecom, and tech industries
they failed because they weren't cognizant of what they were really merging
conflicting sectors made it hard
Also where the large corporate campuses began to start

This was definintely a time where there believed to be no limits
control could be (globally) extended to everything

In Britain, The Ministry of Technology made government use of computing
a centralized 
into ICL- it represents the "very best" of Englisih computing
so England has the equivalent of Bell Labs
But there is a consequence of centralization: it puts all the eggs in one basket

The sit. in USSR, Chile, UK, conglom. corp., they are all centralizing and maiximizing 
as their system of style. But this is not what happened, it was a poor idea centering everything on 
1 inst. 
Conservatives shut down MinTech in 1970, and Thatcherism begins

Computing jobs are shifting from de-skilled, lower-status jobs to 
high-status technological labor 

class strucutures in place, maintained status by rejecting women who had programming langauage
knowledge in relevant languages (COBOL/FORTRAN), they were even hired to train their replacements (men)
which is a disaster for women

When Margaret Thatcher comes in, there was a shift to deregularization, outsourcing, and privitization

COmputing: shift to decentralization, microelectronics, and terminals
labor: a shift to professionalizaton, bifurcated employment (the "rigid barrier") to 
the professional and the non-professionalism

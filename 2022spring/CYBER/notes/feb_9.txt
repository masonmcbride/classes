--------------Time

take the idea of flow and make it the flow of information

Claude Shannon AT&T to Bell Labs

allows FDR and Winston Churchill to commuicate safely -> vocoder

Vocoder by the Military, and autotune for the public

Analog- pitch is locked to speed, with autotune you can one without changing the other

Decoupling a relationship

"Break an object from time itself" means its process and change is not dependent on time, maybe it's new informatoin

Istead of following time you can follow trends 
you can record time by trend

models as a way of predicting the future

schemas are structures 

time is product of railways, 
like time kind of comes out of a product of social interaction
Nothing moved fast enough relative to where the sun is in the sky to not use it to keep time
-- Time was localized in these temporal areas
Time is useful but terribly ficticious 

Two novels could both be 400 pages and 1 book is over 10 years and 1 book is over 1 day
There are some characters that never meet but we can consider them acting at the same time. 
We are breaking time away from a single individual 

Newspaper tell you what's new
weekly vs daily

-> the time span that a media operates in, truly changes the content of that media

A timelapse can just be a single 2D image and it can account for any amount of time. 
A painting can incorporate the same thing

Hydrogen bomb
Climate modeling
Global Warming

Cold War Cyber Systems 
SAGE- Semi Automatic Ground Environment

A system of computers of a vast network of radars that would control the airspace
$67 billion dollars and only 25% effective

Operation Igloo White (1968-1973)
Covert electronic warfare during the Vietnam Wars
used unmanned sensors and deployed them on Ho Chi Minh Trail
then relayed info and made decisions to bomb

A fetishization of the machine happened here
The idea that a machine is better at decisions than you

Strategic Defense Initiative aka "Star Wars"
World-wide system based on satellite relays
$400-800 billion dollar cost

Liberal- an optimistic political philosphy that believes in progress
Humanism- any system of thought or actoin in which human interests, values, and dignity predominate

Technological Progress vs. Social Progress -> liberal pick technological progress

analogical reasong analogy as a universal exchange system
mathematics as the "most colossal metaphor imaginable" -Wiener

Chinese book of changes is the basis of binary computing

You can take an epub file and convert it into a really lightweight, quick, easily compressible (?..sendable?), 
form that opens up in a text based terminal where no mouse is required to navigate through pages 
there can be mulitple modes on top of the text based book and many commands

Visualization: a psychological process (in our minds) that became
a set of rendering practices (carried about by machines)

They are about making the in-human relatable to the human
                    as opp^osed to "non-" ^relatability is categorical

By modeling the world in particular ways, visualizations _train our perception_
and encourage us to think of interfaces as natural

What kind of practices does the interface itself encourage 
optimization
from 1882, "a sufrace forming a commong boundary of two bodes, spaces or phases (ex: oil-water interface)"
Interfaces exist the point of a hyphen [?m-?m]

from 1962, "the place at which indepdenedent and often unrelated [(hetrogenous)]systems meet and 
act on or communicatin with each other"
(ex: the wildland-urban interface)


An interface is a construction where we make incommensurate things commensurable,
this definition implies that we consturct the bridge between objects, rather
than creating the object and its ins and outs

Really complicated photos and images make humans perceive complex and unexpected patterns
which is like a feedback loop in perception

Cybernetic heuristic:
you need a choice between options to guarantee positive amount of information transmission
Idea: recursive shannon theory of information (encoder-noise-decoder) system

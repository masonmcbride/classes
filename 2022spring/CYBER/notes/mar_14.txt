The Mangerial Male Gaze

in the 1960s, there was a transition to electronic machines
but they stil had tape involved

In the early 1960s, female workers were presented as anonymous, faceless
dones perfomring endless taks and servicing an automatic machine

In this sense, the machine has subordinated the worker, ensuring 
compliance, dependence, and reliability

This was attractive to employers who were increasingly unsettled by labor outrest

A cake place ended up becoming the first business computer producer

Depersonalization of the 1960s, ('cogs of the machine', s/t/s) 

For companies and the civil service, women were still considered ideal workers because
they could not expect career advancement

in 1964, MinTech would take these buses around and play films

What does it say about power?

What does it say about the relationship towards the machine

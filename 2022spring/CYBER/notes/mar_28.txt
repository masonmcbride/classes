During the first age of globalization 
Which is when settlements were organized around trade routes

It is first in St Helena that the natural depletion of natural resources becomes visible to humans

climate solutions were also thought about during this time: 
climate theories
empirical studies (by naturalists) 
who are interested in the scientific potential of natural spaces
-> Mauritius Botanical Garden and forest conservation policies 

Created by global networks of colonial admins, scientists, and physicians 
Botanical Gardens were models of the world 
and they helped expand knowledge of wide ranges of Fauna 

Generally, this the process of creating a smaller model consisting of objects that can be 
viewed, picked up, arrangments and construction of categories and morphologies 

It makes knowledge finite (because sets are countable)
and makes global generalizations, and you can create comparisons between the two

Problems with meteorology:
No universal time
2d tempurature measurements
no ability to predict weather
no standard measurement 
-> only for scientific studies, industry was not able to access this

Media Technology Solutions
Steam Locomotive (Railroads) - 1810s
The telegraph - 1840s
The airplane - 1900s
THe radio - 1910s

Solution 2: Modelling

The ENIAC (1945) - an enourmous computer
funded by the US military to fund research and data collection at a vast scale

von Neumann was the first to develop a computer model as to what would happen if carbon 
in the atmosphere doubled
(He wanted to control the weather to starve the soviet union into submission) 

Sometimes models are built open previous existing models 

in the 1960s, satellites were meant to gather photographic images of the weather from above
(BUT THEY WERE REALLY USED FOR SURVEILLANCE)

Model-data symbiosis
-> models _process_ data to integrate it in the model
<- data tunes the paramters of the model
We work from model to data (not the other way around)

Thus, strong connections exist between media technology and global information
corr. Media technology determines what type of information exists globally and we process it as such

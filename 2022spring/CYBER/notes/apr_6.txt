Deluaize & Guttari made their name through theoretical texts
Anti-Oedipius (1972)
A thousand Plateus (1980)

argues that schizophrenia is the logical optimal strategy in a capitalistic system

combined Marx's k on cap and Niechtzes's something
Argued that schizo. is not a problem, rathern
an opporunity for freedom 
created the idea of "nomad thought" 
interactive group theory to produce of collective critique of power relations 
under capitalism . 
They were "free from neurosis" because they were no longer trying to fit in a system that wasn't built for them

NOT pieces of a hierachical unified power structure to be dutifully leanred and internalized

Learning to free yourself, not to participate in the structure more efficiently

Since a rhizomatic strucuture (spore-like model), 
it is post-structural 

graphs are a product of the West's idea of taxonomic structure
instead, a spore-like model can conncet to anything else, there is no set strucutre
(NOTE: just try to combine both)

Social networks (graphs) are not structured hierachically they are free space
other words: rhizomatic thinking is decentralized, networked, unstructured
The oldest strucutre is a single organism 

D&G, The West is obsessed with climax/orgasm, whereas
Balinese cutlure suggests seeking plateau
It a system where intensity grows, but is not dissipated in climax or orgasm

Painters, film-makers, muscicians can use plataeus to incarnate dynamism of these 
intensive states 
If you create the conditions just right, you get a vibe

A big advantage of this pov is how optimistic it is about the future of the world

-----The Freudian Robot:
Freud: psychoanalyst who brought us the unconcious, that that which controls us under our knowledge
What happens when we put together the unconcious and a robot?
What does the robot have to do with our unconcious
Or does a robot have an unconcious itself? 
Q- DOes programming in computer system provide a similar system of unconcious that humans have

Encountering writing in digital media is fundamentally different than writing on a page.

Claude Shannon's The mathematical rewriting of alphabetical writing as an ideographic system.
and the subsumption of all coding systems under Printed English as the "universal writing of
imperial technoscience"

Printed English: is the universal language model 
Q- Is english linear? 

Sense
(noun) and (verb)
Nonsense (is like the reflective background)

Nonsense as a from of rationality achieved through other than sensory perception

"Productive" Nonsense
Zhao Yaoren (Y.R. Chao) - a chinese-amiercan linguist 
produced an infuential grammar of spoken chinese
He even invented new chinese characters to match Carroll's Pportmanteau words in English'

Moving in the direction of Shannon's analysis, Chao's passage suggests an extremely high level of
redundancy in transcribting spoken Mardarin, hence, very little information, but at the same time, 
in traditional chinese it contains a very high level of entropy (or information)

ideogram - a picture or symbol used in system of writing to repersent a thing or an idea
but not a word or phrase for it
phoneme

James Joyce made Finnegans Wake, which took 17 years 
he was trying to create a productive form of nonsense
Finnegans Wake is an experiment in linguistic engineering
Jacques Derrida wrote Finnegan's Wake as a hypermnesiac machine designed to anticipate
all one can possible say in a lnguage and exhaust evey conceiviable combination of verbal elements
Hyermnesia unusual power or enhancement of memory, typically under abnormal conditions such as trauma, hypnosis,
or narcosis

Claude Shannon's mathematical theory of information notably ignored the semantic 
content of message and concenrated instead of how much informatoin could be convveyed, 
recognized in Finnegan's Wake as the outer limits of entropy and lowest threshohld for redundancy 
in the English Language

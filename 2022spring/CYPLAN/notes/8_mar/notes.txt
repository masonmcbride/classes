What does the 

<C> >> <C_random> 

<l> ~ <l_random> 

average shortest distance needs to be similar to a random graph
clustering coeff needs to be much greater than a random graph

EX: N = 375, E = 8124

G_r(N, P) 

G_r(375, what is P)

We know: <k> = P(N-1)
so <k>/(N-1) = P 

>>> 43.3/374
0.11577540106951871 = P 

so G_r(375,0.115)
<l_random> ~ log(N) / log(<k>) = log(375)/log(43.3) = 1.5

Thus, SCMN is not a small world network because its clustering coeff is not much greater than 
a random graph with the same N E's clustering coeff


We can also define the strength of the node

s(i) = sum([w_ij for j in V(i)])
For a weighted directed graph, 

A weight is a property of the links, the strength is the property of the node

Gephi is an open-source software to visualize networks

What it means to have a high pagerank in any abritrary network
is that you are linked by other important nodes
So for immigration, you are getting immigration from important countries

Your pagerank goes up if you are linked to by other important pages

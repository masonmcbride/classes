Network Elements Learning Objectives
0 Solution exercise from last Class
1 Degree
2 Clustering coefficient (defined today in the article) [saying this because clustering is kind of roughly defined in genreal]
3 Shortest path lengths



For each of the 3 metrics you can calculate: 
7 Average in the network, and 8 histogram of the properties

average degree of a graph sum of the degree of each node divided by total number of nodes 
also
2 * |number of edges| / total number of nodes 

average degree of a directed graph

average <in-degree>
average <out-degree>


real world social networks have high clustering and short average paths

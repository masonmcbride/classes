real world networks have two properties 
easy to navigate (short paths)
have a structure (large clustering c >> c^random)

Random Graph defined by (p,N) is built by connecting each pair of nodes with probability p
Q-how do we estimate a random graph based on it's nodes and edges
a- 
1. degree distribution Bell shaped curve around average P(k) = 
2. average degree of a random graph is p(N-1) is (for all networks) 2|E|/N
3. average shortest path length- average shortest path <I^random> is about log(N)/log(k)
4. Clustering coefficient- <C^random> is about p

an empierical network you know E and N
with E and N you can find k
k = 2 * |E| / N

k can be converted into a random graph
c^random = p = <k>/N
l^random = log(N)/log(k)

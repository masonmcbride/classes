Clustering my finding similaries amoing the many dimenios in a multivariatea process, 
CLustering involves sorting observations into groups
Each group is referred to as a cluster 

k-means clustering is equivalent to miminizing the variance of the variables. 

How to quantitatively evaluate differnt values of k in k-means: 
1. K-Means Inertia (elbow method) 
  Finding the elbow in the graph that scores number of clusters by Inertia
  Inertia is sum of distance of datapoint to it's centroid squared, maybe R2 norm or 
2. Silhouette Coefficient or silhouette score
  A metric used to calculate the goodness of a aclustering technnique
  range of metric: (-1,1)
  b - a / max(a, b)
  where
  a= average intra-cluster distance, average distance between each point in cluster 
    (minimize distance in clusters)
  b= average inter-cluster distance, average distance between all clusters 
    (maximize distance between clusters)

You need to be able to interpret your results so you make an observation about the data

Even if you have the max silhouette score, a small amount of clusters still won't even tell you anything

The silhouette score actually tells you about all the local maxes

As a good method of data science development, once you have read in the data and transformed it in some way,
you should save the current data to a static package and basically reset your data checkpoint from there
all code from then on will be opening the file, rather than having all the functions still compose the transofmr

data.census.gov/ced/sci/
then google it and find variable name
api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/acs5/variables.html

don't have it because it's too expensive or don't have it because it's too horrible

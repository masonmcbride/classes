Civil Planning: Introduction to Network
========================================

1. We will use a complex systems paradigm in this class
Complex System Science -- so we can find the emergence of patterns


Every single credit card transaction includes {latitude, longitude, time} :- {spacetime}

History ----------------
Jane Jacobs - journalist and activist
Made us think of cities as problems of organized complexity (compositionality) 
NYC does not have highways, and are car-minimized. 




Smart Cities started as term from Companies, once big data started coming out, companies started getting interested in creating smart cities  

equitable cities--people are interestesd in smart cities but 
smart cities do not look at poeple or their needs
  
URBAN SYSTEMS - 
understanding fundamental proccesses that drive, shape, and sustain cities and urbanization

you don't need big data for Urban Science,
how to read data and how to build a story

WHAT IS A NEWTORK---A network is a graph made of nodes and edges
nodes are entities of a complex system, and
edges are their interactions

punnet square
{weighted, unweighted}
{directed, undirected}

edges are weighted (as opposed to nodes), 
to represent the strength of the interaction

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is a method of data analysis that draws insights\n",
    "from large, complex multivariate processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works by finding similarities among the many dimensions in a multivariate process, condensing them down into a simpler representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, through clustering, we seek to reduce the complexity of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, clustering involves sorting observations into groups. For these groups to be\n",
    "meaningful, members of a group should be more similar to one another than they are \n",
    "to members of a different group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each group is referred to as a *cluster* while the process of assigning\n",
    "objects to groups is known as *clustering*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a good cluster is more\n",
    "similar internally than it is to any other cluster, these cluster-level profiles\n",
    "provide a convenient shorthand to describe the original complex multivariate process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations in one group may have consistently high \n",
    "scores on some traits but low scores on others. \n",
    "The analyst only needs to look at the profile of a cluster in order to get a\n",
    "good sense of what all the observations in that cluster are like, instead of\n",
    "having to consider all of the complexities of the original multivariate process at once. \n",
    "Throughout data science, and particularly in geographic data science, \n",
    "clustering is widely used to provide insights on the\n",
    "geographic structure of complex multivariate spatial data. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "We then consider geodemographic approaches to clustering&mdash;the application\n",
    "of multivariate clustering to spatially referenced demographic data.\n",
    "Two popular clustering algorithms are employed: k-means method.\n",
    "Mapping the spatial distribution of the resulting clusters \n",
    "reveals interesting insights on the socioeconomic structure of the San Diego\n",
    "metropolitan area. We also see that in many cases, clusters are spatially \n",
    "fragmented. That is, a cluster may actually consist of different areas that are not\n",
    "spatially connected. Indeed, some clusters will have their members strewn all over the map. \n",
    "This will illustrate why connectivity might be important when building insight\n",
    "about spatial data, since these clusters will not at all provide intelligible regions. \n",
    "So, we then will move on to regionalization, exploring different approaches that\n",
    "incorporate geographical constraints into the exploration of the social structure of San Diego.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will use in this chapter comes from the American Community Survey\n",
    "(ACS). In particular, we examine data at the Census Tract level in San Diego,\n",
    "California in 2017. Let us begin by reading in the data as a GeoDataFrame and\n",
    "exploring the attribute names."

    "The nature of this algorithm requires us to select the number of clusters we \n",

    "These extremes are not very useful in themselves. But, in between, the hierarchy\n",
    "contains many distinct clustering solutions with varying levels of detail. \n",
    "The intuition behind the algorithm is also rather straightforward: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) begin with everyone as part of its own cluster; \n",
    "2) find the two closest observations based on a distance metric (e.g. euclidean); \n",
    "3) join them into a new cluster; \n",
    "4) repeat steps 2) and 3) until reaching the degree of aggregation desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is thus called \"agglomerative\"\n",
    "because it starts with individual clusters and \"agglomerates\" them into fewer\n",
    "and fewer clusters containing more and more observations each. Also, like with \n",
    "k-means, AHC does require the user to specify a number of clusters in advance.\n",
    "This is because, following from the mechanism the method has to build clusters, \n",

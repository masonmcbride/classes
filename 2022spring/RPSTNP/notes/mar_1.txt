Goal-rethink what stand-ups are

performers are responsible for what they come up with

stand-ups are comic persona(e) to negotiate the demands between the social and social situations
how is the persona constucted? though psychic, social, and technical ways

the persona is constructed, but not just by the performer, but also through feedback 
and sensitivity to audience reaction and response
They are identities that performers use to interact with the audience successfully

In constructing a persona that way, taht person will return to the world Reformed

Posting poning the question "are they real/authentic" to recognition of the persona
as a literally artificial mediator

a.k.a the Instrumentalist View of Stand-Up Comedy
(the same way they use stages, mics, setlists, etc.)

Reading Brodie, we rethink the Instrum. View
ie. that performers are *using* their persona
instrum. view mediate performers 

according to Brodie, they are not quite like us, even if we think they are human beings
What an Instrum. View is lacking, is bidirectional feedback to the performer (i guesssssss)


Representationalist View
Instrumentalist View
Medial View (stand-ups are pieces of media, mediated from the performer)
Dynamic View (collaborative and responsive (as opposed to reactive, which implies pre-computed reaction))
the difference between reaction and response is that you don't think about a reaction, but you do think about a response


The stand-up figure does not think on its, ie. it is not an agent that is the center and uses instruments

Lives are not indepedent but not not indepedent of the performer

The stand-up is not isomorphic with the performer but there is a relationship
Yes the stand-up is human in some respects, but at the same time the stand-up is not exactly a human


Stand-up comedians are compelled to get rid of themselves but they can't
This falls along the lines of the Media View

self-deprecation is a instrumental strategy, because you choose to identify yourself in that way
Abjection is a compulsion, not a goal, based on psychic forces 

The way the world is arranged is not actually how the world has to be arranged

Subversion- showing the way the world it is, and evading it in some way
"Here's how the world is isn't that crazy"
The best we can see subversion acting on norms is that they transform them
subversion is the beginning of a transformation, that can over time
substitute the originally existing norm

Part of the subversion makes the southern audience destablize themselves

There are two very separate ideas of what a southern american is like and what an asian american is like
The first thing that is subversive means he has very little control of that subversion overall
What an asian american is supposed to look like
what a southern american is supposed to sound like

examples: 
"Bless her heart" bit
"me but not all me"



Morgan, "No Dammy Mammy, Moms!"
Jackie Mabely

The role is so safe-seeming, that is allows us to violate norms
She pretends to have memory lapses and misused words to maintain this safe-seeming pov


Valentia, "Laughin at pink ribbon Cuture"
illness as authenticicty
subverting the guilt aspect
Tig refuses to be a shero of breast cancer 
instead says "I dont' know what's going on, but you need to be here with me"
Suberting expectations for being a hero

She doesn't even instantiate those ideas of being a hero, 
so there is subversion in literally avoiding the palpable imagineaton in the first place

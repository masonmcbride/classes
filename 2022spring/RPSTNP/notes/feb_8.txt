-----------Stand-up Comedy as a Genre of Intimacy
Brodie reading

distinction between stand-up and performer
Q-what is the distinction

the stand-up is affected by the performer

Q-What is at-stake for Brodie
The way we look the genre of stand-up
as in... it's still up for grabs

E-so much of stand-up is autobiographical 
Q-Why does this matter
A-the illusion of intimacy, stand-up the style brings people closer together somehow
so the structure is important to understanding how to engage in this intimacy more


The difference between comedy on page/live requires different affect 

exchange - equil - intimate

If you didn't have a microphone, your voice register is much more limited and different forms of communcation,
it's easier to be intimate with more range of voice

you keep your "regular" voice -Layla

In terms of intimacy, the Torres reading gives more intimacy with the camera watching over hishands, It's just anotherw ay of creating a shared access (between smlal object and audienc , in this case)

A- in-group out-group type of structure beat

"The camera brings you close but you can't talk over me"

There are some cases where now with tiktok, twitter, youtube, there can exist much nicher microcommunities that can all get the joke

It takes trust to point out incongruities between audience and performer
Living in the same world

"let me get near you" -> "in but not of" or something
Negotiation requires trust


hearing others laugh is doing teh work of the backpeddle when you're alone you don't feel laugh
the laugh requires trust to laugh

comedians as insiders or outsiders
"i'm inside but I have something new"

"i'm outside and I'm noticing what they do in the inside"
"i'm outside look what I do outside"

Discuss- Aparna Nancherla 
with cultural participation, civic imagination

civic imagination is a form of cultural participation 
new message with old framework

using charged humor "to foster cultural participation"
before you participate in the state, you can reach participation in the culture

with civic imagination, you have to be able to imagine that alternative life
civic imagination adding to the parent-child text dynamics 

showing angry yelp reviews can be really funny- and this is how you navigate it
"it would be annoying, if it wasn't a mystery ..."


Comedians operate at the level of culture
working from the bottom-up, changing the way people think


Brian Bahe
civic imagination- "different gays are different gays, and you can now imagine it as such"
creating his life, encountering situations where he is mistaken as asian even when he is native american, 
and how he can still participate in culture
He is showing how we can participate in a world , even whehn it doesn't work for him


There is a lot of cultural overlap in what comedians talk about
this is what it means to have a civic imagination
where you can share


Matteo Lane
being able to imagine his world, where he forgets that he is being flamboyant 
because his brother is even more over the top


The Internet removes geography from that equation
tribalism now based on idelogical level, emotional level

topos- space, like a topology of the space

the notion of alterity- we define ourselves by what is not you (or the other)

The Internet more broadly makes you feel less alone

Comedy is an identity-based cultural form
But standup is a performance and you are performing that identity
which means they are not representative figures of identity
stand-ups "appeal to" not "identify"


Flame Monroe
making one tribe out of multiple disparate tribes
trying to synthesize these different communities (I would argue through time as well)
Because many of these tribes are historically dated

She uses her body and voices as tactical responses to people around her
She wants to be "accepted"
but she also needs to "accept" the world around her, in order to be tactical you need to accept this space

Emotions are like large repo of expressions and sensations, which are later translated to mean things

Feelings - personal experience
Emotions - social experience (conscious)
Affect - social experience (a-conscious)

Affect is what your body is perceiving all the time
It's hard to study affect because once you start looking closer at 'what's going on here', 
You have already moved past affect

affect is an intensifier, the things you see feel are translated 
affect is the amplification of the vibe

Leave a space open for affect, you might not be able to describe affect but it is there. 

Structural - there are structures that explain things
Post-structural theory - there are structures and different types of structures,
                        they actually reduce real things (because they are models of it) 

Relief theory are those moments where you no longer have to hold yourself back 

They are individual-based because the humor depends on your perception 

It hit you _and_ now you can explain it if you wanted to

Bakhtin: literary theorists, he was Russian

carnival comedy is ambivalent, grotesque, and universal

it is also outlandish; imagine games, food; constant rolicking for a certain period of time;

Europe at this time was incredibly solemn and pious, where your entire world is the church
carnival is kind of like a relief; it's happens right before lent where you go back 
to the pagan experience where you were a body again (opp./t a soul)

ambivalence of experience of being a material thing that is great and sucks
universal: you and me, we are all in it together
grotesque, in this period: men combined with animals, women with animal head but pregant, 
an entire life of material people 

grotestque vs gargoyle: a groteque is just a statue, and a gargoyle emits water

Carnival comedy is ambivalent, does that imply this is a case where there exists no othering,
and if so is that why it's so hard to have othering

In the enilighment movement, there was already a move to clean uip the body 

In periods of time where this blurring would prevail

Nowadays it's not structured in the world the same way

Using Thomas reading, the way a comedy club is set up, not the just the comedians,
the club entire arrengment from the posters on the wall to where they sea attrative white people in the front
reinforces heteronormative and racial structures

assemblage- the idea is that something is more than the sum of it's parts
This is like transcendence, abstraction, 
It's the relationship between the parts that makes the car do stuff

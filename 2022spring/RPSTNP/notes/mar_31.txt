Stand-up comedy has two coreo components: The comic and the audience

And the experimental examples _complicate_ that construction

For drew michaels, he is ambivalently tragic and comic at the same time
it's because he can't hear us laugh so he can't modulate

It makes you think "it is stand-up" which makes you question your belief 
in the fact that we don't laugh at these types of situations

Josh Johnson's mixtape is a feeling/moment you are sharing with him
but his music is something you can connect to in a different way
the music is very sad but the music is very bouncy,
which makes a lingering melancholy

The mixtape uses fading to show that the mixtape isn't linear
or continuous by can be rearranged
You start to interpret the parts of the special as themes, 
rather than a coherent body of narrative and structure

f(f(n)) < f(n+1)
f(f(n+1)) < f(n+2)
since f(f(n)) is less than f(n+1), 
you can replace it in the above ineq. because it will still hold
f(f(f(n))) < f(n+2)

Show f(1) < f(2) < f(3) < ... by induction 



f(f(0)) < f(1)

A joke needs a setup and punchline
a question with a surprise answer

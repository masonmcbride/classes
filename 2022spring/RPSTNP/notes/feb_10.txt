-------- Mitch Hedberg (1999)

"the deviation is so far beyond"

the fact that Hedberg is recording to a CD as a goal, 
as opposed to performing for the performance

Hedberg creates intimacy by making relationships and actions between audience really clear

It's all about taking technology to its edge too, even that can create intimacy

so are we using distance as like figurative language to describe the degrees of intimacy between others? 
Me rn thinks this sounds like a pretty natural language

She must simutaneouly be an insider and an outsider,
"there is sufficient distance for a fresh perspective"
"but sufficient intimacy for a safe performance of that perspective"

There is a professional obligation to remain an outsider is "always in play"

They can't be "inside" forever

Q-is intimacy a static state?

Stand-up intimacy is the illusion of intimacy
The perfomer's persoanlity is distinct from the stand-up's personality

what is the illusion of intimacy doing here

STATEGY-WISE
she used hyper-intimacy in a way to create distance
"to create a buffer"

intimacy and distance
does being intimate mean you are being a insider

are there degrees of intimacy or is intamacy a direction where distance is the opposite? 
is incoherent to say that creating distance is part of being intimate?

think in termsof repoire soy ou can break it

relevance and perspective?

audience world

It's important to talk about center issues '


Just because they are de-Othering doesn't mean it's socially good, 
you could very-well be de-Othered and be exactly what the center thinks you to be


all a genre does it describe the conventions and describe how you perceive the conventions


---Think of stand-up as a form of mediation
also, stand-up as a map of life's hidden order


starting looking for the feel, vibe in stand-ups

Q-How does the whole bring the world into a closer sense of touch? 

The stand-up can either be the chalk, the finger, or the dental probe

Q-What are the effects on the world due to this paradigm

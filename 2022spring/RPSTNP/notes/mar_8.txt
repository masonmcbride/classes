Two Tiers
Strategies: the ways we keep order (strategies are planned in advance)
Tactics: ad-hoc response (tactics are ad hoc)


Nias Thomspon
The article documents how Nias' case was seen as "abnormal assault"
The idea that there can be a "normal pervert"
Nias was able to make herself the subject of her assault rather than her object

The concept of "making do": rather than denying something happened,
she can respond by "yes. and [...]" 
Making do is a type of tactic, but 


Cait Hogan
She was sexually assault and somehow her career was "ended" 
Weird idea that victims lose their humor and can't be funny
It's hard for women to reclaim their identity

You can't make these deeply personal and sensitive jokes if you're 
going stop there and not subvert these existing norms

Q-Why does Hogan receive acceptance or a good reception for sharing 

Sometimes what looks place as a "safeguard" ends up keeping poeple out


Perez

Color-blindness and "Equal Opportunity Offenders" became strategies for racist comedians 
to keep making racist jokes under the notion of "equity", but
in reality it hurts people currently marginalized 

Confirmation as a form of reinforcement 
This is in direct opposition to subversion 

We tend to see the Grammy's a site of representation 
but the people who are chosen racistly and partriachally just because 

Making racist jokes is like saying to the audience that this joke is okay hold in cultural imagination 
the audiene is reacting to the joke positively 

Q-What does confirmation foreclose and/or make possible
When you confirm/reinforce a norm, it forecloses other possibilities
and those possibilities could very well be better for more people
or could include marginal identities

Subversion points out a norm and *subverts* it
Confirmation points out a norm and *reinforces* it

Q-How is confirmation necessary for subversion
You have to assume (confirm) certain established premises to 
create a coherent subversion 
coherent subversions have the power to replace current cultural trajs. 

The comic license of permission: you can start out disagreeing with your audience
This can create the opportunity for subversion ("This is all the most suprising when I begin to deiviate") 

"There are lots of ways to be on the inside of a phenonemem as long as you confirm it exists"

"This is so normal that we can describe it as this trivial thing but that's how normal it is"
"What I'm making fun of is that we don't take this seriously by not taking it seriously"

Representational 
Instrumental 
Medial (Human somethings)

Now we try to consider the ways in which stand-ups live alongside human beings

Beyond persona, beyond instrument, how is this human stand-up "alive" and it's about authenticity
Thinking about how personae are both human and nonhuman

At bottom, artificiality is not the opposite of authenticity

What is the role artificiality plays in being authentic

Performativity- you are always faking something to make it real

Theme 2: How do we think about the depths of "really being human" rely upon extended networks of 
norms conventions and expectations

One of the ways is to embrance technology as part of being human (this is literally cyborg)

1. How does authenticity rely on artificiality?
2. How does being human rely on a wider field of human and nonhuman actors and artifacts?

This will help you think about what the rhetoric of performance really is

Ambivalence and how they subvert and confirm the status quo

2 comedians 
in light of
1 thinker from writing

also how the two stand-up use
subversion of confirmation of the status quo 

consider how their comedy subverts and confirms the status quo

NOTE: label the ambivalence and stay with it
both poles (you need a range(a, b))
NOTE: maybe even include a diagram of the subversion of confirmation

You need to have a positive and negative that you are going to use 
praise/blame

use the ambivalence

You can't really have an end or resolution when you are ambivalent
It makes us question the norms
redefine the artist comic relations
Removal from the comic frame

When you take an ambivalent position with an object you can't resolve it any way,
because by definition there is no positive and negative force exerted on the object.
It exposes the objects postive and negative by holding both types at the same time. 

in Math, an ambivalent position is called a fixed point, and a fundamental way of 
proving is thus: consider the function f and point p, a fixed point is where f(p) = p. In other words, 
when  point p is the input of the function f, the output of the function is always p, the same as the input. 
Fixed point. This is usually proved by disocvering the function f(p) < p and f(p) >= p. when these hypotheses are combined, the set of possible options that p could be is smushed into a singular option: f(p) = p. 
This math is a fancy way of saying when you create a spectrum where there are poles on it, positive and negative, when you prove that an object could by neither
So for a stand-up to prove an ambivalent tradition, it means that they must prove

-self-marginalization is only good up to a point
The comedy she makes is to reduce tension 
"What do you expect" is a form of tension
"I'm going to meet your expectatoins by telling you know"
and you respond "yes she did and that's very good"

Nanette -> Douglas
instad of building and releasing tension -> she's meeting expectations in a suprising way
"I can give you the whole and we can still go to somewhere greater than that"

-Confirmation is still on the current traj path, 
so just by merely confirming something doesn't mean you are doing anything about it
it is only through subversion (making real actions) that you are doing any real work 

A lot of his jokes are him trying and failing to map these contradictory actions
on the current reinforced world


Jo Koy
It's a way of othering that creates differentiations between different types of others

He is still confirming racist stereotypes about asian people,

There is a differentiation rather than a consolidation 
But we acknowledge that problem is in service of something
I view Jo Koy's performance as a intermediate step into stripping racism from people

Stand-up comedy is selfish because she needs the audience to change before her identity changes as well

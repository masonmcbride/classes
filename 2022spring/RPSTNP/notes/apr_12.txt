For comic synchony you need to be in a discursive community
which means you are operating with different language in those circles 
(immediate reminder of games, dancing)

comic synchony someone can mean something and not mean it at the same time

irony vs. sincerity

stable irony - when I say this utterance I mean the exact opposite of what I'm saying
  this makes it an obvious map because flipping everything to it's opposite is a bijective map
  and nothing changes

  It is stable because all of the meaning is accurately communicated

sincerity - the congruence between sentinment and avowel
  you agree with what you are saying

Bo burnham is prickly towards the audience and they like it
But there is a reverse of the moment

I wonder how when Burnham goes through all the layers 
(Pretending to knock down the water bottle -> 
 Reveals he did on purpose with the )

Parasocial relationships
started in 60s, people noticed others have relationships with television 
The audience is indeed there where there is a perceived face to face

Comic synchony affords more nuance than without it

If the two dichotimies are happening simultaenously
do they cycle around one another 
or does the conflict between them resolve to something 

If you could live a life without an audience do it
We are always performing 

Those two statements are contradictary
Applying comic synchony it means it's possible to not perform but also don't perform

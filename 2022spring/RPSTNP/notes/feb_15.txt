------------ Laugther (in the West) is not taught as a good thing

so it is exceptional that philo of humor are talking about laughing as we do today.

This chapter should give you the sense that (this is not the first step)

Decouple making fun of something is mockery

irreverant- not taking the way "it wants" to be taken

broadband internet
mobile phones
social media

the internet is different now because you can create an infinite amount of different amounts of niche of audience, 
as opposed to back in the day where you had to get up and face and audience you comedy didnt necessarily want tto face, 
because the audience has to be able to buy tickets and has to want to be able to go to a comedy club which means which kinda fixes the audience that it could be to an inflexinable phase space by the parameters. Comedy clubs remind me of a intermediary step becaue these clubs were cheaper and you could find your fav comedian on the internet and access them that way. 
But now you can even make a living of comedy on the internet because niche groups are sustainable on the internet now. 

"At the margain of American Democratic Culture"

Q-How do we go from jokes and laughter to something changing?

middle of page 27, 

In the last 5 years, there has been a demand for margainalized comedians that there is 
There is a material culture where we can actually demand content now, so as we demand
margainalized comics to perform, we have made real social change in a way through 
demand-and-response

(YOU) are making the content that you consume
(AS OPPOSED) to publishing houses that dictate what you consume, from a different perspective, 
it's what (they) want to consume and what they want you to consume as well

"civic" is like how you treat otheers, and you are bounded by your reality how people actually see others, 
but narratives 

also "imaging oneself a political agents" reminds us that we are all political actors, which means the audience members. 

"charged humor"- humor that intenionally 
charged humor fosters a culturally citizenship as opposed to a state citizenship
this implies that there exists a culture and on top of that culture is a State,
and what comes with the idea of the State is all the ideas we know now, but
there exists an underlying culture. 

superiority we laugh when we laugh at someone

relief laugh becuase there are things we able to put down in a joke


So reinforcing dominant culture happening if when you are on the outside
bc when creating connections between inside and outside you have to take a path there, 
and those paths can be through streotypes(?)

The original gatekeeper who decides who is going to be on stage and who isn't,
is not there anymore

instead of thinking in gatekeeper, think of civic imagination

culture jamming is like destablising a ball on top of a pillar by kinda like trying to jam it off

culture jamming is when it doesn't go down smooth

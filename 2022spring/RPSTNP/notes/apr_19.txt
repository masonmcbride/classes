Bateson is concerned with when the frame of communication of the message do not align in some way

There are moments in communication where utterances flip flop meaning over and over
this is opposed to when we write down logic on the paper we can't have meaning flip flop like that
but I believe our communication system does allow for those oscillations 

"you may know a lot about communication but there are many things you miss as well"

What happens when we tell each other jokes
When comedians bring you to a paradox, what is being communicated there?
sometimes it's funny when the power is recognized

There's information when you see the surface 

That fact that we agree to a language system 
Communication is the awareness in our acts of communicating
you have an agreement with yourself on how you see the world

We take for granted that we "make sense" to others 

sometimes we say we "agree to disagree" 
  - the irony is that you aren't really agreeing
  - but you are agreeing you are on the same level of disagreement with each other
  - agreement is at the level of "taking for granted" ie. premise

Play is when you take different "lines (of play)" even though you believe it isn't compatible
then you make many plies on that line and realize there's actaully reward down this path

jokes are the commission and correction of errors 

when you understand an error you admit ways you were led to that error in the first place
it kind of charts an entire map backwards on contradictions

The loss of knowing how to do things is within
When you rely on google maps, we are lost in wayfinding if google maps isn't working
which sometimes is funny even though we aren't even able in the first place to wayfind
but we think a paradox is forming on ourselves because we lack a "human trait" like wayfinding

Concerning inflexibility,
We need to be sensitive to what technology does to us, we should be aware of how the mechanical 
bodies encrusted upon the living. 

Comedians may be machanical but their mechanics are outside of our mechanics, 
which can be funny, they disturb the things yo;u take for granted and they take the crust off
It's simply to make you aware of what you are doing, what you take for granted (assumed premises)

When we use a technology repeatedly over and over, we become mechanical to them
How much is encrusted upon me and how much have I chose to become so. 

How do choose to view something, humor is that it's funny to think [this] way
